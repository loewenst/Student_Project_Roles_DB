## _**Description**_

This app is intended to work something like Google Classroom, only its specific purpose is to assign students to roles in "projects," broadly defined. If there is a weekly chore rotation, a teacher could use this app to create a chore project, and create and assign chore roles to each student. If students are breaking up into four groups, each group needs to do a project, and each group has the same roles - note taker, presenter, leader etc. - the app will allow creation of groups as well, which can reuse already made roles. The app will have allow teacher accounts to add students and assign them to roles, and it will allow student accounts to see their projects and roles for each class they're in, as well as send messages to a teacher about a specific project (like a request to switch roles!).
